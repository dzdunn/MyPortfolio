<h2><strong>The Present:</strong> Who am I?</h2>
<div>
    <p><b>Short version:</b> A newbie developer, drone enthusiast, hobbyist maker (3D printing, arduino, RPi), with a non-technical background and skillset.</p>

    <p>Recent MSc IT graduate with Distinction. Developed skills in C#, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, .Net MVC, Spring MVC, Git, and some knowledge of NoSQL, Angular, Unit Testing, and ORMs such as Entity Framework and Dapper. Worked as scrum developer using an agile scrum test-driven-development methodology to produce an X-machine theory-based software testing tool prototype in Java. Implemented a hobbyist-focused solution for a drone to autonomously avoid collisions on a return-to-home path using C++ and Arduino. Currently deepening my knowledge of C# MVC (with some WPF and WinForms) to develop applications for a personal portfolio and a project called WoodULike, designed to help carpenters share their projects and get contracted for bespoke crafts.  Recently, I have added 3D printing to my time-consuming hobbies.</p>

    <p>
        Previously a Project Manager/Campaign Director for Business Reporter in London, working to promote business technology industries and my clients to C-Suites via and The Telegraph Newspaper.  Acquired commercial and people-oriented skills (communication, marketing, sales, project management). Achieved highest average order value, first company six figure contract, met £230,000+ personal annual revenue targets, developed repeating client base. Prior to that, graduated in Law specialising in IT and company law.
        Now aiming to deepen my coding and technical abilities.

<h3><strong>The Future:</strong> My Ambitions</h3>
<p>
    Currently seeking an opportunity to deepen and professionalise my coding and technical abilities. Whether my own venture, in a leadership role, or has lead developer, I would love to be part of a disruptive project in the future.
</p>

<p>Personally, I think drones, virtual reality, 3D printing, robotics and AI will be the big disruptions coming soonest! But there's plenty of tech disruption to deal with in the meantime.</p>
